Module 14 Tableau


## Overview 

In this module we learned how to use Tableau a data visualization tool. In tableau you are able to upload a data file and build out different types of graphs and maps to show different trends and correlations between the data. In this module we took data from New York City bike sharing companies from 2019 to see if a similar model would work in Des Moines Iowa. We took the data a manipulated to see when the most common times bikes are used, which gender used the bikes more, customers vs subscribers and which days of the week were most popular. Below is an example of one of the data visualizations look like, attached is a link of a complete story with all of the visualizations created!
