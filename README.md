Module 14 Tableau


## Overview 

In this module we learned how to use Tableau a data visualization tool. In tableau you are able to upload a data file and build out different types of graphs and maps to show different trends and correlations between the data. In this module we took data from New York City bike sharing companies from 2019 to see if a similar model would work in Des Moines Iowa. We took the data a manipulated to see when the most common times bikes are used, which gender used the bikes more, customers vs subscribers and which days of the week were most popular. Below is a link of a complete story with all of the visualizations created!

## Summary

The summary of the findings were that most of customers are male and the most popular bike riding times are between 4pm and 6pm. There are a quite a few rides during the 8AM hour Monday-Friday. Another finding is that the majority of the customers are subscribers. Below is and example of one of the data visualizations created and is showing that the difference between genders riding at different times of the day. The orange line is the amount of male riders and you can see it peaks during the 4pm-6pm hours.
